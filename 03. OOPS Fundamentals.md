# 1️⃣ What is Programming?

## Simple Meaning
Programming means giving instructions to a computer to perform tasks.

## Deep Explanation
Computers cannot think or decide. They only execute instructions exactly as written. Programming languages like **C#** help humans write these instructions in a structured and readable way.

## Interview Questions (All Companies)

**Q1. What is programming?**  
👉 Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer follows to solve problems.

**Q2. Why do we need programming languages?**  
👉 They act as a bridge between human thinking and machine execution.

**Google Follow-up – Why:** Why can’t computers understand plain English?
👉 Computers need precise, unambiguous instructions; natural language is vague.

# 2️⃣ Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP) vs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## POP – Simple Meaning
POP focuses on **functions and steps**.

## Deep Explanation
- Data is usually global
- Any function can modify it
- As system grows, debugging becomes hard

### C# Example (POP)
```csharp
int balance = 1000;
void Deposit(int amt) { balance += amt; }
```

---

## OOP – Simple Meaning
OOP focuses on **objects**, each responsible for its own data and behavior.

## Deep Explanation
- Data is protected inside objects
- Responsibilities are clearly separated
- Systems become scalable and maintainable

### C# Example (OOP)
```csharp
class Account
{
    private int balance = 1000;
    public void Deposit(int amt) { balance += amt; }
}
```

## Interview Questions (Product Companies)

**Q1. Why do product-based companies prefer OOP?**  
👉 Because OOP provides modularity, security, reusability, and scalability.

**Google Follow-up – What if:** What happens if we build a large system using only POP?
👉 Code becomes tightly coupled, error-prone, and difficult to extend.

---

# 3️⃣ Class and Object

## Simple Meaning
- **Class** → Blueprint
- **Object** → Real instance created from blueprint

## Deep Explanation
A class defines structure and behavior. Memory is allocated only when an object is created.

### C# Example
```csharp
class Car { public string Color; }
Car car = new Car();
```

### Diagram
```
Class (Car) ---> Object (Red Car)
```

## Interview Questions

**Q1. Difference between class and object?**  
👉 Class is a definition; object is an instance.

**Google Follow-up – Why:** Why doesn’t a class consume memory?
👉 Because memory is allocated only for objects, not for definitions.

**What if:** What happens if you create millions of objects?
👉 Memory usage increases and performance can degrade.

# 🧱 Four Pillars of OOP

# 4️⃣ Encapsulation 🔒

## Simple Meaning
Encapsulation means hiding data and controlling access.

## Deep Explanation
- Prevents direct data manipulation
- Allows validation and business rules
- Improves security and maintainability

### C# Example
```csharp
class BankAccount
{
    private int balance;
    public void Deposit(int amt)
    {
        if (amt > 0)
            balance += amt;
    }
}
```

### Diagram
```
[ Private Data 🔒 ] -> Public Methods
```

## Interview Questions (Encapsulation)

**Q1. What problem does encapsulation solve?**  
👉 It prevents misuse of data and enforces rules.

**Google Follow-up – Why:** Why not keep everything public?
👉 It leads to unpredictable behavior and bugs.

**What if:** What if encapsulation is broken in a banking system?
👉 Data corruption and security issues can occur.

## .NET Real Project Usage
- Private fields in entities
- Validation inside services

---

# 5️⃣ Abstraction 🎭

## Simple Meaning
Show **what** an object does, hide **how** it does it.

## Deep Explanation
Abstraction reduces dependency and allows internal changes without affecting users.

### C# Example
```csharp
interface IPayment
{
    void Pay();
}
```

### Diagram
```
Controller -> Interface -> Hidden Logic
```

## Interview Questions (Abstraction)

**Q1. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**  
👉 Abstraction hides complexity; encapsulation hides data.

**Google Follow-up – Why:** Why do we use interfaces in large systems?
👉 To decouple components and enable flexibility.

**What if:** What if we don’t use abstraction in microservices?
👉 Services become tightly coupled and hard to change.

## .NET Real Project Usage
- Interfaces
- Dependency Injection

---

# 6️⃣ Inheritance 👨‍👦

## Simple Meaning
Child class reuses parent class features.

## Deep Explanation
Inheritance promotes reuse but increases coupling if misused.

### C# Example
```csharp
class Vehicle { }
class Car : Vehicle { }
```

### Diagram
```
Vehicle
  |
 Car
```

## Interview Questions (Inheritance)

**Q1. When should inheritance be avoided?**  
👉 When relationship is not truly "is-a".

**Google Follow-up – Why:** Why do Google engineers prefer composition?
👉 Composition is more flexible and less coupled.

**What if:** What happens if base class changes?
👉 All child classes may break.

## .NET Real Project Usage
- BaseEntity classes

---

# 7️⃣ Polymorphism 🎭

## Simple Meaning
Same method, different behavior.

## Deep Explanation
Polymorphism allows new behavior without changing existing code.

### C# Example
```csharp
class Animal
{
    public virtual void Sound() { }
}
class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Sound() { }
}
```

### Diagram
```
Sound()
 ├─ Dog -> Bark
 └─ Cat -> Meow
```

## Interview Questions (Polymorphism)

**Q1. How does polymorphism help scalability?**  
👉 New implementations can be added without modifying existing logic.

**Google Follow-up – What if:** What if polymorphism is not used?
👉 Code becomes full of if-else conditions.

**Why:** Why is runtime polymorphism important?
👉 It enables dynamic behavior selection.

## .NET Real Project Usage
- Payment gateways
- Logging providers

# 🏗️ REAL PROJECT CASE STUDY – ONLINE SHOPPING SYSTEM

## Problem
Support multiple payment methods and user roles.

## Design
```
Controllers
Services
Interfaces
Models
```

## Mapping OOP
- Encapsulation → private user data
- Abstraction → IPaymentService
- Inheritance → Admin, Customer
- Polymorphism → Card, UPI, Wallet payments

## Google-Style Question

**How would you add a new payment method without touching existing code?**  
👉 Implement the same payment interface and inject it.
